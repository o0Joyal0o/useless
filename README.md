#  ANOYING TIME SHEDULE  üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CRAFTWORLD


### Team Members

### Project Description
The Fun Calendar Project is an interactive calendar application that allows users to select a day and see a fun number associated with it. The project is designed to be visually appealing and engaging, with animations and hover effects to enhance the user experience.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We are solving the "problem" of making time management unnecessarily complicated and entertaining! Why settle for a boring calendar when you can have a fun, useless one that gives you random numbers and fake dates for every day? Our project brings joy to the mundane task of scheduling by making it as ridiculous as possible.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a calendar that ignores all logic and gives you a random, totally useless number for every day you pick! With quirky animations, fake dates, and a playful interface, our app turns scheduling into a game of chance. Why be productive when you can be entertained by the absurdity of time itself?
